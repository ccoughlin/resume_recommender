    "## Outline Of Approach\n",
    "I'll be using a [retrieve and rank approach](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html#retrieve-re-rank).  The basic idea is to reduce what could be a huge list of possibilities with an initial coarse filtration (the \"retrieval\"), then apply a fine filtration (the \"rank\") to return the best possible results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the universe of available candidates, choose an initial list of candidates with a (relatively) fast and performant technique.  I'll be using the excellent [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#quickstart).\n",
    "* From this subset, re-rank the candidates with a more sophisticated technique.  Here I'll use sentence-transformers' [CrossEncoder](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html), which is basically just the standard transformer architecture we all know and love.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the high level, but how will I handle lengthy documents?  I can't just truncate at 256/512 tokens, because there's a good chance that I'll miss the most relevant parts of the resume.  That leaves me with using a sliding window to extract subsets from each document.  I usually get fairly decent results just splitting on whitespace, but here I'm mainly interested in trying out [NLTK's sent_tokenize](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's the full process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenize** : split each document into a list of sentences.\n",
    "2. **Retrieval** : for a given query, run a semantic search against each tokenized resume (list of sentences).  The relevance of a given resume to the query is then the maximum score (dot product) between the query and the resume's sentences, and the most relevant resumes are the top N resumes by score.\n",
    "3. **Ranking** : for each of the top N resumes found in Step 2, compute the [score](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/cross_encoder.html#sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder.predict) between a query string and the most relevant sentence in the resume.  Re-order the top N resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Here I'll use a set of resumes from [florex's resume_corpus](https://github.com/florex/resume_corpus).  There are several thousand resumes in the corpus, so rather than extract to disk I'll just read them directly from the archive.\n",
    "\n",
